## 🚀 Self-Hosting Instructions

Hosting Tabdash yourself is straightforward. You'll need two main components: the **PocketBase** backend and the **React** frontend.

### 1. Backend: PocketBase Setup

1.  **Download PocketBase**: Get the latest version from [pocketbase.io](https://pocketbase.io/docs/).
2.  **Initialize**: Run `./pocketbase serve` to start the server.
3.  **Create Admin**: Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/` and create your first admin account.
4.  **Import Schema**: 
    - In the Admin UI, go to **Settings > Export collections**.
    - Click **Import (JSON)** and paste the contents of `pb_schema.json` from this repository.
    - *Note*: Ensure the `TabDash` and `TabdashUsers` collections are created correctly.
5.  **Configure API Rules**: 
    - The schema includes predefined API rules for security. 
    - Make sure the `TabdashUsers` collection allows public creation if you want users to sign up themselves.

### 2. Frontend: Configuration & Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repo**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cyberhirsch/Tabdash.git
    cd Tabdash/frontend
    ```
2.  **Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory based on `.env.example`:
      ```bash
      VITE_POCKETBASE_URL=https://your-pocketbase-url.com
      ```
3.  **Install & Build**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```
4.  **Deploy**:
    - The `npm run build` command generates a `dist` folder.
    - You can host this `dist` folder on any static site host (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or your own Nginx/Apache server).

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **No Sensitive Data**: All API URLs are configured via environment variables. Ensure you don't commit your `.env` file.
- **Data Ownership**: Since you host the PocketBase instance, you have full control over your dashboard data and uploaded files.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Zustand (State Management)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Modern CSS variables, Flexbox/Grid)
- **Grid System**: `react-grid-layout`
- **Backend**: PocketBase (Database, Auth, Real-time)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
